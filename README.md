# Snak-Game
Basic recreation of the game Snake.

Decided to rebuild the game for fun and much needed practice. This is my first personal project outside of college coursework.
Pretty helpful in practicing the usage of git and github repositories. I tried to showcase as many stages as possible 
in the git branch but I forgot to commit and push when I made notable changes. I'm learning. 
  The only super hard part about this project was getting the Snake to actually grow. Had to rework the entire code like 3 
times until I made the wise decision to use the Stack ADT to track the snake's body. After that (and realizing that the top
of the stack is not index 0), everything was made far easier. I really loved playing this game as a kid, so it was nice to be 
able to rebuild it.
